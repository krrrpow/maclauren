# Web Designer Challenge

Please clone this repository, make the necessary changes and then create a pull-request.

Following basic boot-strap site perform the following:

1. Create a login page (login.html), with a customers logo
1. Create a signup page (signup.html), with a customers logo, for those that do not have a login, asking for a number of details, including name, email, zipcode and password

There is no expectation that it will work, merely present the look'n'feel and user experience.  The pages should present a unique skin that builds upon the bootstrap CSS.

Do not spend more than 48hrs maximum.
